Level 5 Games Dev Module
Create a game and market it using everything learnt in the first semester
This is a 2 player physics game where the player has to move cubes and reflectors to get lasers to there exit points. 
The game uses Unitys input system (Can use Controller and keyboard)
Biggest difficlutlies include the cube clipping the walls and how to get the player to hold the object
Ended with a portal based system
Also tried giving user feedback to the actions happening (Color Codes etc)
Had alot of issues with the dropping of objects and them being stored on the player / would revise this system in future
Laser System was complex so had alot of changes over developement and glad it came out the way it did
